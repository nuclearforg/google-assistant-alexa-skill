This skill provides you full Google Assistant functionality through your Alexa enabled devices as if you were speaking
to a Google Home. The only problem is that you'll end up really annoyed by constantly repeating *Alexa, ask Google
(...)* and buy a real Google Home :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
